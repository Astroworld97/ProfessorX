Important:

Your app will crash if its Info.plist doesnâ€™t include usage description keys for the types of data it needs to access. To access Core Bluetooth APIs on apps linked on or after iOS 13, include the NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription key. In iOS 12 and earlier, include NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription to access Bluetooth peripheral data.
